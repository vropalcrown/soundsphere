# AudioSplit

A web-based prototype of a PC app to route audio output simultaneously to multiple headphones and devices. This is a Next.js app bootstrapped with Firebase Studio.

## Cross-Platform Prototype

This application is built as a web app using Next.js and React. This means it can run on any modern web browser across different operating systems, including **Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS**.

While it demonstrates the user interface and features of an audio/video sharing tool, it does not have the low-level system access to control hardware directly. In a real-world scenario, this web-based UI could be packaged into a native desktop application using a framework like [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) or [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) to gain access to system audio and hardware controls.
